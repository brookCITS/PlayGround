# Unit Three: Deep playground
In this unit you will practice the basic concepts of machine learning with practical examples.
Deep playground is an interactive visualization of neural networks, written in
TypeScript using d3.js.

## Development

To run the visualization locally, run:
- `npm i` to install dependencies
- `npm run build` to compile the app and place it in the `dist/` directory
- `npm run serve` to serve from the `dist/` directory and open a page on your browser.

For a fast edit-refresh cycle when developing run `npm run serve-watch`.
This will start an http server and automatically re-compile the TypeScript,
HTML and CSS files whenever they change.
